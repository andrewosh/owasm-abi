# owasm-abi
Oasis WASM ABI (Legacy and new)

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/owasm-abi)

This crate is forked from [paritytech/pwasm-abi](https://github.com/paritytech/pwasm-abi). 

We are big fans of the work [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) is doing to advance the state of Ethereum and smart contract development. In order to further experiment with new features including new opcodes and gas models, we have forked these repositories.

In the spirit of open-source, we intend to contribute bug fixes and new features upstream and will make our changes available to the community.
